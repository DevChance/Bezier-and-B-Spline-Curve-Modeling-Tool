## ‚ú® Project Highlights

**Why This Stands Out:**  
This 2D modeling tool, developed in **C++**, lets users intuitively render and manipulate **Bezier** and **B-Spline** curves with interactive features for real-time editing. It‚Äôs not just a tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a window into the beauty of mathematical structures and their real-world applications.

- **Dynamic Visualization**: Seamlessly adjust curves and watch them transform before your eyes.  
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Powered by **de Casteljau's algorithm** and matrix formulations for cubic splines.  
- **User-Centric Design**: Built for creatives, designers, and mathematicians alike.
